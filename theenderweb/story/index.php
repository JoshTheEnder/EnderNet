        This story is semi-based around ShadowKatStudios' story so I may link
        parts for you ( the reader ) to go read before hand. When I write the
        story and post it up here, <b>it will not be in chronological order</b>.
        If you have ever played <i>Beyond: Two Souls</i> on the PS3 then my
        uploading style may be similar to that. I will post a 'timeline' picture
        to indicate where abouts that chapter happens :)<br>Anyway, Ender out o/

        I awake suddenly, body aching, in what appears to be a circular road. Completely disoriented I get myself to my feet and begin to wander to the sidewalk. <br>
        I look around; all I can see is dimly lit bits of what looks like a small residential district. I look up to see the sky; it's a full moon tonight. <br>
        “Urghh, that wasn’t the experience I had expected” I say to myself. <br>
        As I rest myself against a light post, I check my heartbeat locator and see a blip. "There he is...” I say to myself as I walk off in the direction of the blip. <br>
