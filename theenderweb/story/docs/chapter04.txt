    Ender: "Urghh, morning EnderBot"<br>
    Bot: "I would say the same back to you but it's literally just turned noon" <br>
    Ender: "wow, I guess that time jumping drained a lot of energy from me"<br>
    Bot: "So it seems"<br>
    I generally only have 3 hours of sleep max, so you can kinda tell that suddenly sleeping for near on 12 hours is weird <br>
    Ender: "Right, let's go get something to eat" <br>
    You may be thinking "he can't be human, can he?". that is true, Planet Earth is not my original home world. I can't recall the name of my home world but I can remember the brilliant structures we had there. Sadly it all got lost in a great war long ago of which I also cant remember the details. <br>
    Ender: "you managed to find any Wi-Fi hotspots?"<br>
    Bot: "There was one, though trying to even load Google was only getting about 25kBs"<br>
    Ender: "damn, was hoping we could see if theres any electrical stores about, that and somewhere to eat "<br>
    Bot: "I'll keep searching"<br>
    Ender: "Okay"<br><br>

    The street was completely empty. Not another soul in sight, though that changed as we rounded the corner. This street was fairly busy, most people keeping to themselves as they went about their daily routines. A few people gave a curious look at us but quickly resumed their activities.<br>
    Ender: "Any Wi-Fi hotspots you can find, hook onto them and try and figure out where we are"<br>
    Bot: "Will do"<br><br>

    Continuing along the street, we found an electrical and computer store.<br>
    Ender: "Oh good, I'm going to go in and get some stuff, you wait here. Don't want to attract to much attention"<br>
    Bot: "Understood"<br><br>

    I come out about 5 mins later with a computer and various electrical items.<br>
    Ender: "Right, lets head home"<br>
    Bot: "I wouldnt really call it a home but whatever."<br>
