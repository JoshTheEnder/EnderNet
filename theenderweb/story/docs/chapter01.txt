    <b>*loud gasp*</b><br>
    I awake suddenly, body aching, in what appears to be a circular road.<br>
    Completely disoriented I get myself to my feet and begin to wander to the sidewalk. <br>
    I look around; all I can see is dimly lit bits of what looks like a small residential district. I look up to see the sky; it's a full moon tonight. <br>
    “Urghh, that wasn’t the experience I had expected” I say to myself. <br>
    As I rest myself against a light post, I check my heartbeat locator and see a blip. "There he is...” I say to myself as I walk off in the direction of the blip. <br>
