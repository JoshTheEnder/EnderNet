          Well hello there, welcome to my site. <br>
          This site is home to my random projects and may include stuff from other people :) <br>
          Use the links up the top or at the side or wherever I decide to throw them, to get to the other areas of my site. <br>
          as you can probably tell at the moment theres not much on here, I know about it and I am adding more content when I have the time :) <br>
