        Updates are comming today, I will link to the pack download when I have it ready. 
        I'm also going to put the 1.6.4 world + pack into a subfolder for previous players to get.<br>
        1.6.4 world + pack can be found in the <b><a href="/downloads/enderverse164/">downloads</a></b><br>
        <h1 style="color:white"><b>Yes, it's finally here. Download be <a href="/downloads">here</a>. Apply on the OC Forums or just ask me on IRC. Happy Hacking!</b></h1>
        I'll edit this post more in a bit.
