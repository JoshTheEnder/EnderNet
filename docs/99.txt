		Today, Sunday the 15th of June. My Father's cat, Collumbia, passed away at the old age of 16.<br>
		The vet said that he had an infection in his mouth and his kidneys had shut down and even if we were to hospitalise him, the vet gave him about a week left to live. 
		He had a good run in his 16 years. I estimate he used 4 of his 9 lifes.<br>
		He will be sorley missed :'(
