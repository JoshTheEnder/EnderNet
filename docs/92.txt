    Boo! Did I scare you? No? Oh well, I tried.<br>

    Secrets. We all have them, some more than others. Some share their secrets with others, some keep them all hidden away. 
    Some are stupid habits we have when no one is watching, others are more serious. Some of them we keep locked away and 
    try to run from them because the thought of friends and relatives knowing haunts them.<br>

    To say I have a fair few secrets would be a mild understatement. I’d like to say I’m good at keeping my own and other’s 
    secrets, well, secret. I have quite a few that could quite possibly change my relationships with my friends so I choose 
    to keep it all locked up. It’s not good to that for a long time, you start to lose your mind a bit because you’re afraid 
    of it slipping out. Afraid of the consequences but more afraid of the effect it has on the people you hold dear. Some 
    secrets should never be exposed. Some are flaws you can work on. Some need to be unlocked and let free before they drive 
    you insane. Though for some, the insanity is less painful than the alternative. I have a few secrets currently that I 
    never want to let free until I have a means of replacing the void that would be left behind.<br>

    Anyway, enough of my over-thought ramblings, Ender out o/<br>
