		<del>It just occured to me that my story needs a name but I cant think of any good ones :/ If you have a suggestion send it to me using one of my many means of contact :)</del>  It has one now thanks to Dean4Devil, it's called "The Ender's Games" ^_^<br>

		Development is going slow at the moment, mainly because my main playing version is 1.6 and I don't want to attempt to backport so meh. 
		Once ThermalExpansion is out for 1.7 I'll probably continue it (because then I'll be able to use the power system and LordFokas' StargateTech will also be released
		so I can use the abstract bus system from that \o/ )<br>

	<p style="color:white">
		I released chapter 4.2 yesterday \o/<br>
		The next segment will probably be the last of the 4.x range and after that the chapters will probably start being semi random again.<br>
		I have also been thinking about converging with ShadowKatStudios' Hexadecimal based calendar system and writing chapters to go with that 
		but I haven't set anything in stone yet. I'm also not sure how I'll go about doing the hex-based chapters.<br>
		Here, have an interesting gif I found today<br>
