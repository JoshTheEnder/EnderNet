      Walking to the station this morning seemed odd. The usual background noise from the motorway seemed non-existent and the flow of human life at this hour was severely reduced, not another soul in sight. I crossed over London Road to get myself to the station and on the train that would take me to Southend. I approached the ticket machine, selected a return to Southend, payed for the ticket and headed towards the platform.<br>

      The usual security guard was not on the barriers this morning; this did not strike me as odd though because he was probably on the other barriers. I fed my ticket into the barrier.<br>
       "Fuck!" I exclaimed as I received a large electric shock from the barrier whilst retrieving my ticket. Rubbing my hand, I proceeded through to the platform and waited for the train, responding to texts from my friends to pass the time.<br>
<br>
      8:44 rolled around and the train wasn't here yet there had been no mentions of it being delayed. "Wonderful" I muttered to myself when the train had still not shown up 5 minutes later. I heard the alarms from the barriers as they started their closure. Shortly afterwards a train headed Southend bound made its way through the station at an alarming speed. As it sped past, I noticed it was empty and only had seven carriages. A short while after the eighth carriage made its appearance though a lot slower than the other seven that had gone by. It eventually lost its momentum and stopped a little way down the tracks but enough to make the barriers return to their open position. Giving up on the idea of getting to college via the train, I walked off the platform, jumped over the station barriers and headed back home.<br>
<br>
      Seeing as I have some time to kill as I walk back home I might as well tell you a little about myself. My name is Lizzy Trickster; I am a nineteen-year-old female from a little town called Stanford. I have long blue hair that I wear in a ponytail, to the left hand side of my head. Now my skin, my skin is cool. I have naturally pale skin but on one side of my body, I have faint pale-blue-circuit-like tattoos which I have had for as long as I can remember.   I usually keep them covered up because people like to make fun of them otherwise. My eyes are a greenish-blue colour that glow ever so slightly in the dark;I can see better in the dark than most of the people I know. My attire is mostly dark: my footwear consists of knee-high black platform boots; a purple tartan skirt that comes down to just above my knees; I have a stylish gray ripped tank top under a dark red coat that has 2 zips on it allowing it to only be zipped up in the middle; I have a pair of black armwarmers that have red laces binding them and when I’m not out in public i usually have a cat-ear headband on which looks really cute.<br>
      [Might want to reconsider the clothing description]<br>
<br>
      “Hey! Sister of Darkness!” a voice called out, it was my sister, Azzie. She has bright red hair that covers her shoulders; her eyes are like mine but a bit brighter; she wears a plain grey tank top underneath a leather jacket; slim fit jeans that were ripped in a few places; fingerless gloves and ankle high leather boots. Her skin was nearly as pale as mine and clear from any tattoos. Today, she had decided to wear makeup. She had contoured her face and winged her eyeliner. She tucked her hair behind her ears, something I’ve noticed she does unconsciously.  She quickened her pace to walk next to me. “Have you seen anyone around recently? There was no-one at school, and yet it was all unlocked.” she said.<br>
       “There wasn’t anyone at the station either, but  ⅞ s of the train came flying through. There seems to have been a crash down near the petrol station but there was no-one standing around it and usually there is a few people around those sort of events.” I said whilst retrieving my keys from my pocket and unlocking the front door of our house.<br>
      “How was your day?” My mother asked in a sarcastic tone. <br>
      “It was good, yours?” I respond in an equally sarcastic tone.”I couldn’t get to college because the trains are having issues, there’s no-one on the station and the last train came through at an alarming speed with the back of it trailing slowly behind it.”.<br>
       “And the school was all unlocked but there was no-one there, I looked in every room that I could and there was no other soul there.” Azzie added. There was a small pause whilst our mother processed what we had just told her and tried to work out if we were telling the truth or not. A few seconds passed before she spoke again. <br>
      “So. You’re telling me that everyone just got up and left for no reason?” she said. <br>
      “If they did all just move somewhere else, there wouldn’t be as many cars around. I doubt that an entire town walked somewhere without good reason, is there anything on the news?” I replied, still slightly confused about the series of events that had happened so far myself. <br>
      “Now that you mention it, nothing has been on the television all morning except the voiceovers between shows.” my mother added. <br>
      I pondered to myself with the possible reasons as to why nobody was around for a short while before I had an idea where I could get answers from. "Oh, just remembered that I have a way to scrape through huge portions of the Internet in a few hours. Sadly, he's about 7 hours away." I said. <br>
      “Didn’t he go insane?” Azzie asked, looking at me with confusion. <br>
      “He may have done, but he’s the best chance we’ve got. I’m going to start up my server farm to start scanning it from here.” I responded before turning to head upstairs.<br>
       “Do you know how much your farm costs me when you run it?” my mother asked bitterly. <br>
      “Yes, I do. If people start showing up again, I will gladly pay the excess.” I responded, making my way upstairs followed by Azzie.<br>
<br>
      “What’s your plan? Come on, I know you have one.” Azzie teased.<br>
       “You up for some hacking? My server farm is great and all but it’s not as powerful as it could be, I’ve prepared a USB stick that will install a small OS to whatever device you plug it into and then uplink with a predefined server and dedicate its resources to the server” I said in an enthusiastic tone. “I want you to go around to every house you can, if they have a computer, plug it in and load it up. The more the merrier”. Azzie stood in the doorway to my room whilst I fired up my servers and prepared a couple of USBs for her and loaded the software for a small project of mine that i codenamed Nightwatch. I finished up the preparations, handed her the USB and went over the details with her again so she knew what she was doing.<br>
<br>
      A thought crossed my mind, that this was a perfect time to test Project Nightwatch. I dug through my cupboards till I found the two sets of headgear I had made for it, each set consisted of an earpiece and a pair of hi-tech contact lenses in a sealed container. <br>
      “What’s that?” Azzie asked eagerly. <br>
      “This is Project: Nightwatch, I worked on it a couple of years back but then stopped it as I kinda lost interest. This part goes in your ear and allows you to talk to and hear other people, the contacts go in your eyes and they can grant you all manner of useful tools like night vision and picklocking guides.” I said with a smile seeing how Azzie’s eyes lit up at all the mischief she could cause. handing Azzie a set then proceeded to put in my contacts and earpiece in and waited for it to link up to my phone and server farm. Azzie followed my guidance and put the contacts in and earpiece, we gave it a test run to confirm it was working at short distances and it was a success. I grabbed my bike gear and proceeded downstairs and out the back door to get my bike.<br>
<br>
      “Azzie, can you still hear me?” I asked her over Nightwatch whilst moving my bike around to the front of the house and getting a nav session set up on my phone to Cornwall.<br>
       “Yep, loud and clear, you heading out now?” She responded.<br>
       “That’s correct, if you need anything give me a shout” I responded before revving up and speeding off to Dartford which was the first checkpoint on my journey.<br>
       “Have a safe trip!” I heard Azzie say as I left.<br>
