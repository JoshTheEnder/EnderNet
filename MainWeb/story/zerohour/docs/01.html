      I awoke to the sound of an alarm on my computer. I rolled over to see my clock, it showed 7:36 am which confused me because the only alarm I had set on there was in the afternoon. I sat up and checked my phone to make sure that my alarm was actually correct, which it was. Coming to the conclusion that my computer had somehow lost its time and couldn’t readjust I got up and turned off the alarm. Looking at the time on the taskbar I saw it read 7:37 am and the date was also correct. I checked the various alarm and calendar apps I had to see if there was something important I was meant to do at this rather odd time but they all came up empty.<br>
      <br>
      I then checked the app that had been making the alarm earlier and noticed it wasn’t one of the normal apps I use for alarms. The alert had originated from a script I wrote in Python that monitored trends on the internet so I checked its logs to see why it was sending out an alert.<br>
      <br>
      Looking through the log from the previous 24 hours I saw the normal large numbers for the different trends, some emerging and some dying down. I got to the part of the log which was from 7am onwards and started noticing the numbers dropping rather rapidly; down to 80% of the norm at 7:10, 50% by 7:20, 20% by 7:25 and below 5% at 7:30 which is what ended up triggering the alarm. I checked various social media sites and everything looked normal for the most part. I looked at the day of the week, it was a Thursday more commonly known as college day. I put the trend drop to the back of my mind whilst I got ready for college. I have some time to kill before I leave the house so I check my email. The usual morning emails: amazon, humble bundle, zone alarm trying to sell me their latest product. Nothing out of the ordinary there. With my emails checked I put my computer into a low power state and headed downstairs and out the front door to college.<br>
      <br>
      Walking to the station I noticed an odd sense in the air, it seemed cleaner in some way. I made my way to the train station to catch the 8:32 train that would get me to Southend on time for the start of the college day.<br>
