        The room was silent, the only noise I could hear was the trees swaying in the wind. I felt a heavy object on my face. 
        At first I thought it was EnderBot being mischevious but I felt it and it was warm and feathery, in a blind panic I got 
        up at lightning speed and pinned the object that the warm feathery things belonged to against the wall with my tentacles.<br><br>
        "The fuck Ender?" said Lizzy in a bitter tone, "That's the 4th time you've done that this week!". 
        I stood there as waves upon waves of what could only be described as a mix of shock, horror and confusion swept over me. 
        "You gonna let me down?" Lizzy said in an exasperated tone. I moved my tentacles to behind her back and pulled her close to 
        me and hugged her tightly. <br><br>
        "Gah, too tight too tight!" Lizzy groaned as I hugged her with most of my strength. I released my gip a little so she 
        wouldnt be as squashed. <br>
        "I'm sorry Lizzy, I'm still not used to having living company about" I said in an apologetic tone with tears rolling 
        down my face. <br>
        "Well you better get used to it because we're not getting separated again" She said in a stern voice. "How did you forget 
        me though? We've only been separated for just over a month." said Lizzy. <br>
        "For you, yes. For me, well. It's been about 103 years since I last saw your face." I said while releasing my grip on her.
        "How did that happen? Did you get the Vortex Drive in The Darcath working?" Said Lizzy with a smile on her face.<br>
        "Well, yes and no. Yes it worked, no it doesn't work to design. It's a lottery, it doesn't listen to any of the input 
        controls apart from the activate button." I said with a sigh.<br>
        "Well, I might be able to help with that" Said Lizzy, giggling. "How so?" I said in a puzzeled tone.
        "Well, when we completed the binding ritual I gained the ability to time travel. Want me to show you?" said Lizzy, sounding 
        proud of the fact that she could possibly time travel.<br>
        "Err, sure." I said. "Okay, my watch currently says 15:45 and I'm going to jump forward 5 minutes." said Lizzy
        "Oka-" I said getting cut off by Lizzy time-shifting out. "Huh" I muttered aloud.<br><br>


        Not more than five minutes later I detected space-time distortions around where Lizzy had been. There was a thunderous clap 
        and a flash of bright light as Lizzy emerged from the void.<br><br>

        "15:45 my watch says" said Lizzy with a proud smirk on her face. I grabbed her hand and looked at her watch, it did indeed 
        show 15:45 before jumping to 15:51 because of it's automatic corrector. "Well" I said, "This changes everything."<br>
        I pull Lizzy in close and kiss her passionately.<br>
        "Come on you, we've got work to do" I say with a smile. "Ohh what do you have planned?" said Lizzy, giggling
