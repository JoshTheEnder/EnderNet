    Ender: “Right, I think it is about time that I tell you about my past”<br>
    <br>
    Lizzy: “You mean our past?!”<br>
    <br>
    Ender: “Yes. Well. First things first, some background information on me and Lizzy. 
    I’m 986 years old, Lizzy is 942 years old. The term years being relative to our home planet, 
    Thra’s standard year. In Earth years it would be about 1470 years for me, 1440 years for Lizzy 
    so we’ve been around a while.”<br>
    <br>
    Lizzy: “Yeah, also another major difference between Earth and Thra is the way we do what you 
    humans call “Marriage”, here on Earth you exchange vowels and treasures as a way of saying 
    that you’ll look after your spouse. On Thra it’s a bit different, the same basic principle of 
    “I swear to be with you till death do us part” but we don’t exchange vowels or have a whole 
    ceremony for it. It’s a bit deeper than that, with our version the couple perform an ancient 
    ritual which is the joining and combining of the souls of the couple. The ritual is only 
    successful if the couple are right for each other. If it fails then there is no harm done, 
    the couple can stay with each other or venture out to find their true soul mate”<br>
    <br>
    Ender: “If it succeeds, like it did in our case then the souls are bound for all eternity
    and the couple’s abilities are enhanced tenfold. If for whatever reason one of the couple
    is to pass away, the soul of the deceased shall become a spirit guardian to the remaining
    physical soul.”<br>
    <br>
    Lizzy: “Basically, if you manage to kill one of us in the flesh, the other becomes as powerful
    as both combined with the free soul keeping their psychic abilities”<br>
    <br>
    Ender: “If you were to compare us to, say, legendary pokemon then Lizzy would be Dialga and I
    would be Giratina. We do have a friend who would match the style of Palkia but they haven’t
    been introduced in the story yet so we’re not going to spoil it, hehe”<br>
    <br>
    Lizzy: “Ender! Quit breaking the 4th wall” Ender: “Sorry”<br>
    <br>
    Lizzy: “To allow you to put things into perspective in terms of timelines, we initially started
    the binding ritual when we were only about 100/70 (Thra years) but about 5 minutes into the 
    ritual a race known as the <i>Imperious</i> attacked.”<br>
    <br>
    Ender: “The Imperious were and probably still are brutal savages that will wipe out entire
    civilisations just to get their technologies. Even if the owning race is very open at sharing
    they will not hesitate to wipe them out so that they are the only race to have it.”<br>
    <br>
    Ender: “we were slightly prepared when it came to them using our stuff. It was programmed to
    violently explode in the event that they tried to use it. Which would have been fine had they
    not all tried to use a lot of them at once on our planet. Luckily most of us planned for that
    potential flaw and escaped before it happened. The Imperious are also not that smart. When
    attacking planets they will use anything and everything they can, which means that they could
    be efficiently wiped out if the planet was to explode. Which is what happened with Thra.”<br>
    <br>
    Lizzy: “our heritage is also a bit messy, my mother and Ender’s father are native to Thra. 
    The other half of our parents? Not so much. My father was a Timelord from the planet Galifrey,
    I’m not sure if he’s still out there or not. Ender’s mother was from a race known in their
    native tongue as Anquiatas, they have all ascended or died of old age by now.”<br>
    <br>
    Ender: “You might also be wondering where I got my unnatural appendages from. In truth, I
    don’t know. I have had them for as long as I can remember but I don’t think I had them during
    the binding ritual.”<br>
    <br>
    Lizzy: “I saw you take a shotgun blast to your back when we were fleeing, that might have
    something to with it. It also makes more sense of you think about the fact that we had only
    half completed the ritual.”<br>
    <br>
    Ender: “makes sense I suppose. I think that’s all we needed to discuss. Can’t remember what
    we’re doing in the next chapter but I think it has death and explosions so it’s going to be cool”<br>
    <br>
    Lizzy: “You like breaking the 4th wall don’t you?”<br>
    <br>
    Ender: “Yes. Here’s the end of the chapter” <br>
