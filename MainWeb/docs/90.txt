    I'm working on my site again so \o/<br>
    Over the next few days I'll be moving more stuff about so this news column
    will move to it's own sub section and only the latest one will be shown here 
    (on the home page) to make way for other things to be on the main landing page.<br>
    As for story updates, Zero Hour has been put on hold for a bit until I can post
    quite a bit of it all in one go; Ender's Game I have a chapter in the works for
    which is dated a few days after the events of The Siren so look out for that soon
    (I'll aim to get it out by the 11th of January).<br>
    As for general life stuff I start my first job on Monday (5th) which is gonna be fun
    considering my sleeping pattern is slightly fucked at the moment :/ oh well, hehe.<br>
    That's all for now, Ender out o/<br>
