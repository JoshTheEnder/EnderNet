        Hello again, chapter 4.4 of my story dubbed "A1_C4T" has been released now \o/<br>
        Also I might switch to just name based chapters, because of the way my story is going makes chapter numbers seem stupid. 
        That and the fact that timeline is going to be jumpy for a while now.<br>
        Also my minecraft server that I run, updates will be comming tomorrow (monday). They inlude Modular Power Suits, ComputerCraft (because SuPeRMiNoR2 wanted it) and updates to existing mods.<br><br>
        That's all for now,<br>Ender out o/
    </p>
