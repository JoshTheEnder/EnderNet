    Lately I've been working on a different story to Ender's Game, it's current title is
    <i>Zero Hour</i> but I might change that to something different if I think of something
    better.<br><br>
    As for other updates, lately I've been working on EnderBot3 and it's making good progress at least on the base level.<br>
    Currently in the base it can get user details such as their nick and NS account and allows for modules
    to be dynamically loaded. I plan to have it ready and have a few modules by the end of the week and will basically pick
    up where v2 currently is.<br><br>
    Site updates: I generally have not been motivated to work on the site recently but I do plan to fix it up in preperation
    for releasing the first few chapters of Zero Hour. I should also probably add like a "services" section where people
    can get information about stuff like ZNC, MC, whatever.<br><br>
    Also I have ideas for another one of my "overthought ramblings" which is about Paradoxes and time travel. I'll probably
    post it on Saturday to both here and my <a href="http://jtheender.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>.<br><br>
    That's all for now, Ender out o/<br>
