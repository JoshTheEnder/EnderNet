      So, recently one of my friends told me about Vultr. Initially I didn't think about
      it much but after looking at what they offer (to see if it was any better than Digital Ocean)
      I wanted to switch over to them. In terms of hardware performance and storage, the plans don't
      have any differences. Though what they do have is a proper IPv6 /64 block and the ability to
      buy more IPv4 addresses should I need them. They also have a much bigger range of pre-loaded
      distros for you to use as well as the ability for custom ISO support. <br>Anyway, enough about
      new server hosts, lets talk about the servers themselves.<br><br>
      As of me writing this, I have 4 servers: Thor (Dedicated server in Canadia), Heyo &amp; Anquietas 
      (VPS' from DO in London) and the newest addition: Janus (Vultr, in Paris).
      Janus is going to be the Successor to Heyo &amp; Anquietas and has the same CPU, RAM and SSD space
      as Heyo for about 2$ less.<br><br>

      I am in the process of either migrating things from Heyo &amp; Anquietas to Janus/Thor or disabling
      stuff if I nolonger need them. It also means there is going to be some down time for this site
      and the others I host (StargateTech2 Wiki for instance). I will also be messing around with Nginx
      and Python based web development so that will be fun. <br>
      That's all for now, <del>Ender</del> Lizzy out o/<br>
